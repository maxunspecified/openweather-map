# Unspecified-Weather.github.io

The above mentioned is actually one of my first projects at the earliest which is a weather app, build with the help of openweather API.

The API used in this weather app has been exclusively used by maxunspecified so, make sure to change the API before using it, you can enter the API through the Json file.
